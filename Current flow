Here’s a textual representation of the flow diagram that you can use in a Word document. You can later format it into an actual diagram using Word’s built-in tools like shapes and arrows:

Flow Diagram - Function-Level Overview

1. Entry Point: call(body)
	•	Description: Main entry point of the pipeline execution.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Define config as an empty map.
	2.	Resolve the body closure to populate the config.
	3.	Call startterraformAppIaCPipelinePlugin(config).

2. Function: startterraformAppIaCPipelinePlugin(config)
	•	Purpose: Orchestrates pipeline stages based on the configuration.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Initialize terraformAppIacValidator.
	2.	Validate that the job is not calling itself.
	3.	Configure pipeline utilities (e.g., logging, notifications).
	4.	Validate and check for job chaining.
	5.	Call Sub-Functions Based on Configuration:
	•	scmDownloadStage(config): Manages source control downloads.
	•	executeEnterpriseSecurityScan(config) (if enabled): Triggers an enterprise security scan.
	•	sonarScanStage(config): Performs a SonarQube code quality scan.
	•	packageStage(config): Handles packaging logic.
	•	publishConfigurationStage(config): Publishes configuration files based on the branch and environment.
	•	readReleaseConfigFile(config, stage): Reads release configurations and processes environments.

3. Function: scmDownloadStage(config)
	•	Purpose: Downloads source code from SCM.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Perform SCM checkout.
	2.	Validate downloaded code using terraformAppIacValidator.

4. Function: executeEnterpriseSecurityScan(config)
	•	Purpose: Executes an enterprise security scan.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Validate scan configuration.
	2.	Trigger the security scan process.

5. Function: sonarScanStage(config)
	•	Purpose: Conducts a SonarQube code quality analysis.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Pass the required configuration to the Sonar plugin.
	2.	Log results and metrics.

6. Function: packageStage(config)
	•	Purpose: Packages files based on branch and environment.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Execute custom packaging logic (if defined).
	2.	Log packaging metrics and results.

7. Function: publishConfigurationStage(config)
	•	Purpose: Publishes configuration files to the target environment.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Validate the environment and workspace details.
	2.	Build configuration stages.
	3.	Publish configuration files to the TFE workspace.

8. Function: readReleaseConfigFile(config, stage)
	•	Purpose: Reads and processes the release configuration file.
	•	Steps:
	1.	Parse the JSON release configuration file.
	2.	Extract environment-specific details.
	3.	Assign environment-specific configurations to config.
	4.	Validate phase and branch compatibility.
	5.	Call packageStage(config) or publishConfigurationStage(config) based on the current stage.

Cleanup and Notifications
	•	Sub-functions:
	1.	pipelineUtil.cleanWorkspacePostBuild(config): Cleans up the workspace after the build.
	2.	pipelineUtil.sendEmailNotificationOnSuccessAndUnstable(): Sends notifications based on the build result.

You can use this structure to create a flow diagram by representing each function as a box and linking them based on the dependencies and execution flow. Add decision points (e.g., conditions like if config.execute...) as diamonds in the flowchart for better clarity.
